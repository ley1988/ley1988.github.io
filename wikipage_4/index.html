                    <span class="bold">Coquí</span> for several species of small frogs in the genus Eleutherodactylus native to Puerto Rico. They are onomatopoeically named for the very loud mating call which the males of two species, the common coqui and the upland coqui, make at night. The coquí is one of the most common frogs in Puerto Rico, with more than 16 different species found within its territory, including 13 in El Yunque National Forest. Other species of this genus can be found in the rest of the Caribbean and elsewhere in the Neotropics, in Central and South America. The coquí is an unofficial national symbol of Puerto Rico; there is a Puerto Rican expression that goes, “Soy de aquí, como el coquí”, which translates to “I’m from here, like the coquí."[1]

                Eleutherodactylus is a small tree frog that can vary in color. These frogs can be a mixture of brown, yellow, green, and gray on the top and the bottom side of their body is either white or yellow. The eye color is a variation of brown and gold. They can range in size from 15mm-80mm.[2] The first word of the species' scientific classification is the genus name Eleutherodactylus which is Ancient Greek and Modern Greek for "free toes", referring to the fact that this species has no webbing in between its toes.[3] The coquí have special disks instead of webbing on their feet, differentiating them from many other types of frogs. The special disks on their feet help the coquí climb and stick to trees and leaves.

                The environmental degradation caused by Hurricane Hugo in 1989, the hurricane in 1998, and the two-year drought from 2015 to 2017 have all had a massive impact on the 28,000 acre El Yunque rain forest in Puerto Rico including the resident coqui frogs. Increase in average temperature has already increased the incidence in coqui frogs of Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, a chytrid fungus that reduces the reproductive capability and increases mortality of the Coqui frogs. The more recent hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017 hit Puerto Rico.[9] Irma did not directly strike Puerto Rico, but Maria with wind speeds only two miles per hour shy of a category five impacted Puerto Rico directly two weeks later and devastated the forest on a massive level. Specific conditions prevented some sites from massive destruction, but 53% of the Puerto Rican El Yunque rainforest[10] was devastated the forest canopy that had shielded the ground from the sun  and left the ground shaded and cool, was destroyed by Hurricane Maria, and the ground temperature has thus increased by 4 °C. Small changes in release and uptake of carbon dioxide create much larger changes in its atmospheric concentration. The warmed ground areas have shown less root recovery from hurricane damage. Several of the more vulnerable Coqui frogs (E.eneidae and E.karlschmidti),[11] whose ranges are contained within the lower altitudes of the El Yunque National Forest are in imminent danger of extinction. This has increased the range and success of more resilient species of Coqui frog, especially the Red Eyed Coqui, which can withstand drier periods, fluctuations in temperature and other conditions, as many of the 25 species of Coqui frogs can. In the Luquillo Mountain range, the Mountain Coqui was not endangered, but a result of Hurricane Maria it might have become so.[citation needed]

                <h3>The coquí and the Taino people</h3>
            <span class="bold">The coquí symbol</span>

            <p>
                Researchers have found petroglyphic images of coquí, including in a cave on Puerto Rico's Mona Island filled with 13th-century petroglyphs depicting Taino culture.[19] With these images, archaeologists were able to understand certain aspects of their way of life, including customs, art, and beliefs. The repeated coquí symbol suggests the influence of the coquí on art, poetry, and decorative works such as pottery in Taino society.[citation needed]
                In these carvings, the positioning of frog-like hands represented “femaleness.” In addition, coquí frogs with their rich vocals before a rain were said to be associated with women's fertility and children.[20]
            </p>
            <span class="bold">The Taino frog legend</span>
            <p>
                In one legend that explains the birth of the coqui, a goddess fell in love with Coquí, the chief's son. She told him that she would come one evening, but she never came. What did come was the evil Juracán, the deity of chaos and disorder. The sky blackened as the winds quickened. The goddess tried to protect her lover, but Juracán grabbed him away and they never saw each other again. In order to cope with the loss of her Coquí, she created a frog that will forever call out his name: “Co-kee! Co-kee!,” Hence, the birth of the coquí.[21]
            </p>
            <p>
                Another Legend states that a god named Guahoyona abducted all women from the island, leaving the men to take care of the children, who out of hunger began to cry 'toa toa' or mother-mother. When the children could not be consoled by the men, they turned into frogs.[22]

                Puerto Rican boy band Menudo had a song named "Coqui",[23] which they sang on their movie Una Aventura Llamada Menudo, on a scene where coquis can be heard. Also, one can hear the sound of a coqui in the song "Todo me recuerda a ti" by Pedro Capó.[citation needed]

                The sound of a coqui can be heard distinctly at the beginning and end of the songs "Acércate" and "Ángel Caído",[24] by singer Ivy Queen.
                
                In the first movement of The Mars Volta's song "Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore", 4 minutes of coqui frogs can be heard singing (credited as "The Coqui of Puerto Rico" on the album sleeve).[25]
            </p>
            <span class="bold">The coquí in literature</span>
            <p>
                Aside from music, the coquí has also made it in the genre of children's literature. Most notably, Callaloo, a well known children's media brand that makes educational and entertaining stories relating to diversity and different cultures,[26] includes a story titled Callaloo: The Legend of the Golden Coquí. It is the second installment in the series, about two kids from New York who travel to Puerto Rico trying to free the golden coquí frog trapped in El Yunque forest using clues left by the Tainos as well as getting help from other coquí frogs.[citation needed]
            </p>
            <span class="bold">The coquí and climate change</span>
            <p>
                A study published by the Proceedings of the Royal Society B states that long term temperature rises from climate change has caused significant increases in pitch and shortening of their duration. The increasing temperatures impact on a coquí's call is shown to reduce their body size as well reduce biomass population. This can lead to dire consequences because coquí frogs play an important role in the Puerto Rican rainforest.[27]
            </p>
            <p>
                If temperature continues to increase, coquís as a whole are predicted to sound and look different in the next century. The survival of the coquís depend on the female coquí's ability to adapt to these changes. If their inner ear are not able to adapt then they won't be able to pick up higher pitched calls leading to mating issues. In addition to coquí population decreasing, having smaller coquís to eat or be eaten by other organisms can destabilize the whole food web of Puerto Rico's rainforest.[28]
